# HexaPaymentDemo

**HexaPaymentDemo** is a demo project that implements a payment processing system using **hexagonal architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters Pattern). This design promotes modularity, decoupling, and flexibility, making it easy to integrate with various external services and interfaces without affecting the core business logic.

## Features

- **Modularity**: The business logic is fully decoupled from technical details like payment providers, databases, or user interfaces.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable by adding new adapters for different payment providers or new user interfaces (e.g., REST APIs, graphical UIs).
- **Testability**: With clear separation of concerns, unit and integration testing becomes straightforward.
- **Scalability**: The design encourages a clear separation between business logic and external details, making it easier to grow the system with new features.
- **Containerization**: The project includes **Docker** support for easy setup and deployment across different environments.


## Architecture

The project follows the typical structure of hexagonal architecture:

- **Domain**: Contains the entities and business rules (e.g., payment processing).
- **Ports**: Interfaces defining contracts for system inputs and outputs.
- **Adapters**: Implementations of ports that connect the core domain with the external world (e.g., payment providers like Stripe or a REST API).
- **Configuration**: Where system dependencies and configurations are managed.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Primary language for implementation.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building applications with dependency injection support.
- **Maven**: Build tool for project management and dependency handling.
- **REST API**: For external interaction with the system.
